        The Tools for Learning, Design and Research (tldr) group is a multidisciplinary team based in the Dyson school
        of Design engineering at Imperial College London. With activities spanning online education, generative design
        and simulation-based characterisation, this team is brought together by a common theme of tool making. As such,
        we strive to produce easy to use, high quality, open source code and publish supporting content that enables
        others to make use of it.
